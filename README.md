# Elm-Counter

A simple (extremely simple) designed to explain how the Elm language works.

You can find this app on the Try-Elm site listed as one of the beginning examples.

### This demo was created as a part of a conference I gave at the University Anahuac Mayab in Mérida, México about the Elm programming language.
